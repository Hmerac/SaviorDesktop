## Savior Desktop Platform
This desktop application is made for the officers working in police stations and hospitals who get notified when an accident happens in their dependent area.

When an accident happens in that area, the officers will be notified by this application about the information of what, when and where the accident happened. After being notified, officers will deploy squads to reach the accident.

### Savior Mobile Platform
Volunteered people registered to this application are responsible for sending information to the officers by this application. They only need to take photographs by their mobile phone, describe the area and report those with just clicking a button we provide.

### Idea:
The purpose of the project (Mobile and JavaFX) is to increase survival rate of people who suffer from accidents. We want to achieve that by giving officers trustful, exact and immediate information.
